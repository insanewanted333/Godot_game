Game name : Whispers Beyond the Trees

🕯️ Chapter One: Childhood
In a quiet rural village, surrounded by forests and pine trees, a child named Jeffy was born.
He lived with his mother in a small wooden house after losing his father early in life.

His childhood was ordinary—he went to school each morning, came back to eat with his mother, then played by the house or ran among the trees.

One day, while his mother was preparing food, something happened that changed his life forever:
A pot of boiling water spilled on him, severely burning his face.

He was taken to the hospital and stayed there for a long time, receiving treatment in silence.
When he returned home and to school, no one treated him the same.

Students mocked him. Some were afraid of his appearance. Everyone began to avoid him.
Even the teachers seemed unsure of how to speak to him.

Jeffy felt like an outsider. No one came close. No one tried to understand.

🕯️ Chapter Two: Loneliness
A year after the accident, Jeffy faced another trauma:
His mother died in a tragic car accident.

He moved in with his grandmother, an elderly woman who cared for him with food and shelter—but never warmth.
She showed no affection and didn’t make up for the loss of his mother.

Over time, his isolation grew.
He dropped out of school and began spending all his time in his room.

He would sit for hours by the window, watching other children laugh and play.
He heard their joy from afar, and slowly, sorrow, envy, and hatred took root within him.

He saw the world moving on happily—as if no one had ever noticed what happened to him.

🕯️ Chapter Three: The Inner Darkness
At fourteen, something began to shift inside him…
It wasn’t just sadness or solitude anymore—he started showing signs of deep psychological disturbance.

He would stare into the mirror for hours, whisper strange things, speak to himself, laugh without reason, and feel as if someone was always watching him.

He began to feel strange impulses—visions of violence… of blood.
Terrifying images flooded his mind, and reality blurred with illusion.

Around the same time, news began to spread in nearby villages:
Untraceable murders.
Victims killed silently in their homes. No noise. No clues.

People gave the killer a name:
“The Silent Killer.”

But the shocking truth? The killer… was Jeffy.

He would sneak out at night, slip through the trees, select his victims carefully, kill them quietly, and return home like nothing ever happened.

He wasn’t after money or direct revenge…
He was releasing all the pain and hatred that had been festering inside, driven by a growing psychological storm.

🕯️ Chapter Four: The Game Begins
Now… Jeffy was seventeen years old.

The game starts in his room, at his grandmother’s house.
The air is cold. The room is dim. The window slightly open.
We hear soft breathing… then her voice calls from downstairs:

“Jeffy… dinner’s ready.”

He stands slowly, walks toward the mirror, sees the reflection of his scarred face.
Lifeless eyes. A deep mark stretched across his cheek.

He bends down, pulls out a sharp knife from under the bed, hides it in his coat, and begins to move.

From here… the story begins.

Game Rules:

But... sometimes, even the innocent get caught in the dark.

🔋 Power Boost:
The more Jeffy kills, the faster and stronger he becomes.

How to Kill:
Only when no one else can see you.

Atmosphere:
Thick fog in the forest

Darkness inside homes

The End:
After slaughtering those who hurt him—and those who never knew him—Jeffy soaked the village and woods in bloodstained silence.

One night, hiding between the trees, he saw a child being bullied.
A strange feeling stirred inside him.

He remembered that day—the boiling pot, his mother’s scream, his disfigured face, and everyone’s stares.
He remembered the loneliness. The fear. The silence.

He began watching that child from afar, day after day.
And noticed something strange…
The boy wasn’t angry. Or scared. He seemed at peace—untouched by cruelty.

Jeffy sat still in the woods, reflecting on this contradiction.
He felt something break inside—not pain. Not rage. Just… silence.

He stood. Walked back to his grandmother’s house. Knocked on the door.
When she opened it, he said softly:

“I just wanted to see you.”

Then turned, and walked toward the woods—where it all began.
Where his loneliness was born. Where he first screamed.
Where his face was once whole.

He stood between the trees, closed his eyes, tilted his head to the sky…
And in utter silence… he ended everything .
